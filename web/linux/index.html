            <h2 id="01" class="topic">What is Linux?</h2>
            <p>Linux is an operating system kernel. Because of it's free and open source nature, it's widely used in basically anything that runs an OS, especially on embedded systems, servers, smart TVs and supercomputers. It was originally written with the C programming language, however recently there has been some code added with the Rust language. It's worth noting that the term "Linux" can be used to refer to both the OS kernel and the OS itself, but for better distinction some people call the OS itself GNU/Linux as it's composed by the Linux kernel and GNU utilities</p>
            <h2 id="02" class="topic">The importance of Linux</h2>
            <img src="https://gnulinuxsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Linux_Is_Everywhere-001.png" alt="Linux is everywhere" width="100%">
            <p>As stated before, basically anything that runs an OS is running the Linux kernel, you probably own a device that runs on Linux. Smartphones are a big example of this, since most smartphones run Android or a variation of it, they are essentialy running Linux. Another market where Linux dominates are web servers, where Linux account for approximately 80% of the entirety of the internet servers. Big tech companies, such as the infamous FAANG (thx meta for ruining the acronym now) constantly rely on Linux.</p>
            <h2 id="03" class="topic">The creator of Linux: Linus Torvalds</h2>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia article about the greatest man alive">
                <img src="https://pplware.sapo.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/linus-torvalds.jpg" alt="The Penguin God - Linus Torvalds" width="100%">
            </a>
            <p>Linus Torvalds is a Finnish <b><ins>genious based gigachad</ins></b>. He created Linux for a project at his university (University of Helsinki) because he was too broke to afford an operating system at that time. He was born on 28 December 1969, in Finland's capital Helsinki. In 2010 he was naturalized in the United States. While his most important contribuition to our modern society was the Linux kernel, he is also the creator of the widely used Git technology.</p>
            <h2 id="04" class="topic">Reasons to use Linux on your desktop</h2>
            <img src="https://149695847.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pasted-image-0-3-768x576.png" alt="Linux distros" width="50%" style="margin-left: 25%;">
            <p>There are so many reasons to ditch your Windows 10/11 or macOS in favour to Linux, here are just a few of them:</p>
            <h3>1- Free as in Freedom</h3>
            <p>Installing Linux is totally free of cost, you don't need to pay $200 to get rid of that annoying watermark. But that's not the only "free" thing on Linux. As stated earlier, Linux is fully open source and it's licensed under the GPLv2 License, which guarantees that the end user has the the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software. The software is yours and you won't be kept restrained like you are on Windows (a proprietary OS), where you can't even uninstall Edge without it popping again after a few days (my recommendation is to use Firefox or one of it's forks, such as Librewolf or Waterfox).</p>

            </a>
            <p>There is also a ton of different Linux distros (distribuitions) to choose. If you don't like one, just change to another. Each distro offer a unique experience, with different package managers, Desktop Environment, specific customizations and tweaks, etc. and you can make an OS that matches your taste. Here is mine:</p>

            </a>
            <h3>2- It's not a spyware, adware nor malware</h3>
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.en.html" target="_blank">

            </a>
            <p>As you can observe from the following table, which is absolutely in no way biased, Linux is the only desktop OS that is not prejuditical to your privacy and mental health.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Windows</th>
                    <th>MacOS</th>
                    <th>Linux</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th style="text-align: left;">Is spyware</th>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                    <td>No</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th style="text-align: left;">Is adware</th>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                    <td>Yes*</td>
                    <td>No</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th style="text-align: left;">Is malware</th>
                    <td>Yes</td>
                    <td>Yes*</td>
                    <td>No</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p style="font-size: 10px;"><small>* I'm too broke for a Mac so idk but problly is lol</small></p>
            
            <h3>3- Low on resources usage</h3>
            <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">
                <img src="https://i.redd.it/83g56tyac8931.png" alt="Debian ftw" width="80%" style="margin-left: 10%;">
            </a>
            <p>Linux is very well known for being able to breathe new life to old computers. An Intel Celeron, 512mb of RAM and 10GB of disk space is more than enough to do simple tasks on Linux. Just install a lightweigh distro and your 15 year old laptop is good to go. Once when I was using Arch linux with bspwm, fully setup and customized to a 100% functional desktop, memory usage on idle was 300mb (I had 16gb of RAM total). On the image above, we can observe someone's Debian install with the LXDE desktop environment.</p>

            <h3>4- Rock solid stability or bleeding edge update, you choose!</h3>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--iNwZ4tjf--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dfcg7t35jngphrh6s1sd.png" alt="Linux stronk" width="60%" style="margin-left: 20%;">
            <p>Linux distros fall on either category. You can have a stable system that never breaks itself or you can be adventurous and opt to receive always the latest software available. These are the point release and rolling release update cycle repectively. The following table has some examples of each. </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Point release</th>
                    <th>Rolling release</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Debian</td>
                    <td>Arch</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Ubuntu</td>
                    <td>Gentoo</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fedora</td>
                    <td>openSUSE Tumbleweed</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>While rolling release systems needs more caution to not break it, point releases won't break itself and go blue screen, only by manual human intervention such as running the infamous command "rm -rf /" with root privileges.</p>
            <h2 id="05" class="topic">I'm interested, how do I try Linux on my PC?</h2>
            <p>You have 2 different options, try it on a virtualized environment or install on your physical machine.</p>
            <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">
                <img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/How-to-install-Linux-on-VirtualBox.png?width=1198&trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1" alt="VirtualBox" width="100%">
            </a>
            <p>For newcomers, it's generally more recommended to test it on a virtual machine first, such as Virtualbox. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oO9CeZXjTY" target="_blank">Here</a> you can a watch a video on YouTube on how to do so. Just download a Linux distro iso that you are interested in, download virtual box and follow the steps. This is a very easy and practical way to test different Linux distros.</p>
            <img src="https://www.softdownload.com.br/wp-content/uploads/dualboot_ubuntu_windows.png" alt="Dual boot" width="100%">
            <p>When you are feeling more confident, you can install it on your physical machine. You don't need to delete your Windows right away, you can dual boot Windows and Linux. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn7jZ5i1RTM" target="_blank">Here</a> is a video explaining how to do it. Eventually, after you realize that using Linux is making your life 10000% better, you can ditch Windows entirely.</p>
            <h2 id="06" class="topic">What distro should I choose?</h2>
            <img src="https://nixwindows.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/linux-distro-stickers.png" alt="Myriad of distros" width="100%">
            <p>There is a website where you it asks you a bunch of questions and find the best Linux distro based on your answers, it's <a href="https://distrochooser.de/" target="_blank">https://distrochooser.de/</a> but if you want a quick suggestion, use Linux Mint for starters, since it's very stable and similar to Windows so it's a more familiar experience.</p>
